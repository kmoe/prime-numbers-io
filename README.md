# Prime Numbers

While writing a treasure hunt inspired by the DEFCON badge challenges, I needed a prime phone number. That is, a phone number which also happens to be a prime number.

Using the Twilio API, I made a script to find prime phone numbers. Prime numbers are the coolest numbers out there (apart from e and Ï€). So I built [primenumbers.io](http://www.primenumbers.io) where you can find your very own prime phone number.
